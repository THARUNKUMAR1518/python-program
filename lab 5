    largest = max(a, b, c)
    print(f"The largest number is {largest}.")
    ```

6. **Calculate the total cost of a meal, including tax and tip:**
   
    meal_cost = float(input("Enter the meal cost: "))
    tax_rate = float(input("Enter the tax rate (as a percentage): "))
    tip_rate = float(input("Enter the tip rate (as a percentage): "))
    
    tax = meal_cost * (tax_rate / 100)
    tip = meal_cost * (tip_rate / 100)
    total_cost = meal_cost + tax + tip
    
    print(f"The total cost of the meal is ${total_cost:.2f}.")
    ```

    a = float(input("Enter the length of the first side: "))
    b = float(input("Enter the length of the second side: "))
    c = float(input("Enter the length of the third side: "))
    
    if a == b == c:
        print("The triangle is Equilateral.")
    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
        print("The triangle is Isosceles.")
    else:
        print("The triangle is Scalene.")
    ```

8. **Determine whether a given year is a leap year or a common year:**
   
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        print(f"{year} is a Leap year with 366 days.")
    else:
        print(f"{year} is a Common year with 365 days.")
    ```

    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    
    if len(char) == 1 and char.isalpha():
        if char in vowels:
            print("The character is a Vowel.")
        else:
            print("The character is a Consonant.")
    else:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a single alphabetic character.")
    ```

10. **Output three numbers in ascending order:**
  
    a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    c = float(input("Enter the third number: "))
    
    numbers = [a, b, c]
    numbers.sort()
    
    print("The numbers in ascending order are:", numbers)
    ```
